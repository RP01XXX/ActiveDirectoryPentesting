# Internal Pentesting Checklist
## Uncredentialed
### Pre-Assessment
- [] User Identification: LinkedIn Scrape, Dehashed, OSINT
- [] Wordlist Building: Scrape websites, popular sports teams in the area, industry related words from the area. (If a zoo, popular zoo names, if a school, team names)
### Network Enumeration
- [] NMAP Ping scan for living hosts, then full scan of those hosts into a file
- [] Domain Discovery: Use CME to find the DC
- [] Test for Null Domain Enumeration
- [] Screenshot any webpages in the network
- [] Find Hostnames with CME
- [] DNS Footprinting
- [] DNS Zone Transfer
### User Identification
The goal is to build a comprehensive userlist and validate them against the AD using kerbrute.
- [] Pre-assessment work
- [] SMB Attempts: cme, nmap, enum4linux, impacket-getadusers
- [] Attempt to access printers to find usernames
- [] Default or typical users
- [] RPC Client
- [] Kerbrute users to validate legit usernames
### Password Attacks
- [] Using the kerbrute valid users, stuff passwords
- [] ASREP: see if any users had pre-authentication disabled
- [] CUPP can be used to build password possibilities
### Poisoning
- [] NMAP to find hosts with SMB signing not enforced
- [] Responder
- [] MITM6
- [] WPAD attack
- [] URL File attack (for null access SMB Shares)
### Protocol Attacks
General ports I typically see for quick wins but this is really elaborated upon in the worksheet
- [] SMB attacks: enumerate, vuln scan with NMAP
- [] LDAP: nmap
- [] SNMP UDP 161
- [] MySQL 1433
- [] SQL 3306
- [] HTTP/HTTPS
- [] SSH
- [] FTP
- p[ WinRIM
- [] SMTP
- [] Telnet 21
