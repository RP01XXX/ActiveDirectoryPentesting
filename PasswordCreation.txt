## Keyspace Techniques
About Keyspace Techniques
- A method of preparing a wordlist by specifying a range of characters and numbers and symbols in the wordlist.
- A tool used for this is crunch, we can specify numerous options, min and max and options
Example Commands
- crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o crunch.txt
- this will generate all possible password combinations of 2 characters including 0-4 and a-d. The -o specifies a file to save output to.
-cmd: crunch 8 8 0123456789abcdef -o crunch.txt
- this outputs a minimum and and max of 8
- If we know part of the word in the password and want all possibilities you can do the following
-cmd: crunch 6 6 -t pass%
- This says the password is 6 characters and the pass part is followed by numbers
- other character specifiers
- @ = lower case alpha characters
- , upper case alpha characters
-^ special characters including space

## Create password lists from websites
- CMD: cewl -m 8 -w wordlist.txt <URL>

## Geographical password building
- This is pretty simple, learn the area. At the time of creating this I lived in St. Louis Missouri and so often I would use passwords that had the following items.
1. The STL Cardinals Baseball team
2. The STL Blues Hockey Team
3. The STL Zoo animal names
4. Any local sayings like "ShowMeState"

- Aside from this also consider things like
1. The address or zipcode of the location
2. City and State in the password
